# udacity-descriptive-statistics-project
This repository contains project files for udacity's descriptive statistics project. 
In this project, I used descriptive statistics tools such as hypothesis testing, statistical models to perform a case-study where a company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
I worked through the jupyter notebook provided to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
